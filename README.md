This was the overlay for Gentoo build with musl.  musl is a C Standard Library
which aims to be lightweight, fast, simple, free, and strives to be correct in the
sense of standards-conformance and safety.

It is now archived as it has served its purpose as an overlay -- all
the fixes are in the main ::gentoo repository. Thank you to everyone who
contributed!
